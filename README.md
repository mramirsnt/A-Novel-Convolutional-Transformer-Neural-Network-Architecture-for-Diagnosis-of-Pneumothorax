# A-Novel-Convolutional-Transformer-Neural-Network-Architecture-for-Diagnosis-of-Pneumothorax
This is the base line of the A Novel Convolutional-Transformer Neural Network Architecture for Diagnosis of Pneumothorax publication whcih was presented in CSICC 2023. We used Hugging Face and Pytorch to develop this project. I hope I have enough time to make it complete but feel free to contact me, if you have any questions. mramirsanati@gmail.com
