## Overview

This repository contains the base code for our IEEE conference paper, *"A Novel Convolutional-Transformer Neural Network Architecture for Diagnosis of Pneumothorax."* Our work proposes  a general method with aconvolution and a transformer module which can classify CXR images to diagnose pneumothorax by extracting local features,
global features and global features attended by local ones using a novel architecture.
